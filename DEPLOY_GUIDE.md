# Lab 73 Site - GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Deployment Status ✅

The Lab 73 website has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages and is accessible at:
**https://lab73.com.br** (Custom Domain)
**https://giovannemobile.github.io/lab73-site/** (GitHub Pages URL)

## Deployment Setup Summary

The repository is already fully configured for automatic GitHub Pages deployment with the following features:

### ✅ Completed Configuration:

1. **Package.json Configuration**:
   - Homepage URL: `https://lab73.com.br` (Custom Domain)
   - Deploy scripts: `predeploy` and `deploy`
   - gh-pages package installed

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Automated deployment on push to `main` branch
   - Uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action
   - Builds the React app and deploys to `gh-pages` branch
   - Preserves CNAME file for custom domain

3. **Custom Domain Configuration**:
   - CNAME file in `public/CNAME` contains `lab73.com.br`
   - CNAME file automatically copied to build directory
   - GitHub Actions explicitly configured with custom domain
   - Domain preservation ensured on every deployment

3. **Build Configuration**:
   - React app correctly builds for production
   - Assets optimized and correctly referenced for custom domain
   - CNAME file automatically included in build output
   - All tests passing

4. **GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Site deployed from `gh-pages` branch
   - Custom domain configured: `lab73.com.br`
   - Repository has correct permissions for deployment
   - CNAME file preserved on every deployment

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Deployment**: When code is pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Builds the production app (`npm run build`)
   - Deploys the built files to the `gh-pages` branch

2. **Manual Deployment** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Recent Deployment History

The most recent successful deployment was:
- **Run #12**: Deployed on 2025-09-17 at 20:58 UTC
- **Status**: ✅ Success
- **Commit**: Merge pull request #2 - Complete React Application with Production Assets

## Verification

The site is live and accessible at: 
- **Primary URL**: https://lab73.com.br (Custom Domain)
- **Backup URL**: https://giovannemobile.github.io/lab73-site/

Features include:
- Professional Lab 73 Music Studio website
- Responsive React application
- Dark theme design
- Multiple sections: Hero, Services, About, Contact
- Contact form and studio information
- Production-optimized build
- Custom domain with CNAME preservation

## Custom Domain & CNAME Preservation

The site is configured to use the custom domain `lab73.com.br`. To prevent the CNAME file from being deleted during deployments:

1. **CNAME File Location**: The CNAME file is located in `public/CNAME`
2. **Automatic Inclusion**: React's build process automatically copies the CNAME file to the build directory
3. **GitHub Actions**: The deployment workflow explicitly specifies the custom domain
4. **Preservation**: The CNAME file is preserved on every deployment, ensuring custom domain functionality

### Technical Implementation:
- `public/CNAME` contains: `lab73.com.br`
- GitHub Actions workflow includes: `cname: lab73.com.br`
- Build output always includes the CNAME file

## Troubleshooting

If the site is not accessible:
1. Check the GitHub Actions workflow runs for any failures
2. Verify the `gh-pages` branch exists and has recent commits
3. Check repository Settings > Pages to ensure source is set to `gh-pages` branch
4. Verify the CNAME file exists in the `gh-pages` branch
5. DNS propagation may take a few minutes for new deployments
6. For custom domain issues, check DNS configuration and GitHub Pages settings

## Future Updates

Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment within a few minutes.
